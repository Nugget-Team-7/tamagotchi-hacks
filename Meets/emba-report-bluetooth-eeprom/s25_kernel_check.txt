This module tries to identify the version of the used Linux kernel. The following sources are tested:
    - Results of module s24
    - Identified kernel modules in .ko format
    - Identified kernel modules in .o format
    - Filesytem path of kernel modules - e.g.: /lib/modules/1.2.3/bla

Additionally it checks the identified kernel version with the linux-exploit-suggester (https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester) for known exploits.
Finally it tests the kernel modules for interesting combination of closed source modules with debugging information. E.g. Non open source modules with debugging information included.
