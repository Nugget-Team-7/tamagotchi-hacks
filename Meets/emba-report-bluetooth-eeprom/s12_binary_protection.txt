Modern Linux distributions offer different mitigation techniques to make it harder to exploit software vulnerabilities reliably.
Mitigations such as RELRO, NoExecute (NX), Stack Canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Position Independent Executables (PIE) have made reliably exploiting any vulnerabilities that do exist far more challenging.
