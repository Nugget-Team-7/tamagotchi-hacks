[1m=================================================================[0m
This module identifies the usage of critical binary functions in firmware via [0;33mradare2[0m.
Examples of binary functions are system, strcpy, printf and strcat. These functions are configured in the configuration
file config/functions.cfg. The module counts the usages per binary. For strcpy functions it also counts strlen functions
right before the strcpy function. Additionally it checks if the binary is a known Linux binary or unknown and probably
a vendor binary.
